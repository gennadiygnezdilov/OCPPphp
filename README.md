The OCPP 1.6J communication protocol between the charging station and the server is not as complicated as it can be described in the instructions and official documentation. In the manual, I describe sample requests - responses to the main commands of OCPP 1.6J. If you are developing new code, the number of methods will be enough to develop a stable release version.

I have developed a completely service for charging an electric car and has been operating to this day since 2020.

If you have any questions, write to me, I will try to help with the implementation https://www.instagram.com/gennadiy.gnezdilov/
