The OCPP 1.6J communication protocol between the charging station and the server is not as complicated as it can be described in the instructions and official documentation. In the manual, I describe sample requests - responses to the main commands of OCPP 1.6J. If you are developing new code, the number of methods will be enough to develop a stable release version.

My code has been successfully managing hundreds of charging stations around the world since 2020. If you have questions or need help with implementation, write to me on Instagram: [Gennadiy Gnezdilov](https://www.instagram.com/gennadiy.gnezdilov/).
