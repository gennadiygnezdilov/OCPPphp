The OCPP 1.6J communication protocol between the charging station and the server is not as complicated as it can be described in the instructions and official documentation. In the manual, I describe sample requests - responses to the main commands of OCPP 1.6J. If you are developing new code, the number of methods will be enough to develop a stable release version.

I have developed a completely service for charging an electric car and has been operating to this day since 2020, the release was developed in the PHP programming language using the WebSocket Ratchet library.

If you have any questions, write to me, I will try to help with the implementation https://www.instagram.com/gennadiy.gnezdilov/
