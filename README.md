The OCPP 1.6J communication protocol between the charging station and the server is not as complicated as it can be described in the instructions and official documentation. In the manual, I describe sample requests - responses to the main commands of OCPP 1.6J. If you are developing new code, the number of methods will be enough to develop a stable release version.

[php-ocpp-1.6J](https://github.com/gennadiygnezdilov/php-ocpp-1.6J) - My PHP code controls hundreds of charging stations around the world on a commercial basis since 2020 (Turkey, India, Norway, Kazakhstan, Brazil, South Africa, Russia). The PHP script successfully works with charging stations from manufacturers Schneider, ABB, Siemens, Wallbox, Teltonika, Grasen, Beny and many others. If you have questions or need help with the implementation of the OCPP server, write to me on Instagram: [Gennady Gnezdilov](https://www.instagram.com/gennadiy.gnezdilov/). I am always ready to help.
